# E-Prozar


## What do I use in this project?

- react routing
- UseEffect hook
- installing and working with 3rd party libraries

## Tasks

1. Create a navbar with 4 links: `Promotions`, `Winter Offer`, `Spring Offer`, `Autumn Offer`

   - When the user clicks on the `Promotions` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/`
   - When the user clicks on the `Winter Offer` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/category/1`
   - When the user clicks on the `Spring Offer` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/category/2`
   - When the user clicks on the `Autumn Offer` link the browser url is changed to `localhost:3000/#/category/3`

2. When the user navigates to `category/1` or `category/2` or `category/3` the same component is used to display the products (only the ones from that category id are shown)

   - When the url in the browser is `category/1` the first product which is displayed is `Handcrafted Fresh Towels`
   - When the url in the browser is `category/1` the filter by category has `16` items
   - When the url in the browser is `category/2` the filter by category has `15` items
   - When the url in the browser is `category/3` the filter by category has `16` items

3. Move the random product of the day from the `Category` page to `Promotions` page.

   - When the url in the browser is `localhost:3000/#/` the `Promotions` page is displayed
   - Each time the user navigates to the `Promotions` page 3 random products are chosen from the 3 available categories

4. The promotion page has a carousel (React Responsive Carousel from https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-responsive-carousel)
   - The `Promotions` page has a carousel which displays the image of the 3 randomly chosen products.
   - Each slide also has a label which displays a text in the format `For the {xth} of {month_name} {product_name}: from {old_price} to {new_price}` (example `For the 24th of March Generic Frozen Shirt: from $303.00 to $152 !`)
